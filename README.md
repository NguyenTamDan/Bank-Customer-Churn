# Bank-Customer-Churn

This project aims to understand and predict customer churn for a bank. Specifically, I will initially perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify and visualise the factors contributing to customer churn.

### Churn prevention strategies

In general, customers searching for bank services mostly crave for small loan rate and high deposit rate, so that they can minimize their costs or maximize profit, as all rational people want to do. So in order to be the most attractive bank for customers, the rates should be managed in customer-centered traditions. This also includes bonus programs or special offers. Customer-oriented approached helps to build trust and loyalty.

The analysis of sleeping segment revealed that customers almost do not use the services of the bank: they hold few bank products, they do not perform a lot of transactions and rarely do they appear at the bank in general.

Sleeping customers or at risk customers are needed to be talked to, offered some renewals, so reactivated.

As I already mentioned, bonus programs or special offers are good tools for motivating customers, especially the sleeping ones, as in our case. The recommendation is to introduce or increase (if exists) the monetary cashback or bonuses for being an active customer. This would not be so costly as changing the rates, but it will be effective too.

As for special offers, customers will take more bank products or perform more transactions, if they know that each following product/transaction have benefits for them. For example, running a new saving account will have a larger rate compared to existing account. Or having certain amount of transactions during several months will give larger cashback for customers.

Special offers might be addressed also to “good customers” segment. For example, if they give recommendations to their friends, they will receive certain monetary reward. (P.S. Alpha bank has this offer)

The analysis also showed that churners are a bit more likely to be single and female. So it might be beneficial to pay attention to them, as well. It might be informational help like targeted messages with explanations about certain procedures and notifications about more beneficial manipulations with money for females. Ladies may be not fully informed. Special tariffs for single persons might also stimulate them to use bank services.

Another way is to ask the churning customers for their feedback, so that to upgrade the existing system and improve services. Better explanations might be not those which are predicted, but those which are gained after asking the leaving customers directly. So for example, to ask customers to describe their reasons for stopping relationships with the bank.
