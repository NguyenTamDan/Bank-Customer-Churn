# Bank-Customer-Churn
Customer churn (also known as customer attrition) occurs when a customer stops using a company's products or services.

Customer churn affects profitability, especially in industries where revenues are heavily dependent on subscriptions (e.g. banks, telephone and internet service providers, pay-TV companies, insurance firms, etc.). It is estimated that acquiring a new customer can cost up to five times more than retaining an existing one.
### Therefore, customer churn analysis is essential as it can help a business:
- Address customer needs, improve retention strategies, and save costs associated with acquiring new customers. 
- Identify at-risk customers allows banks to implement personalized retention strategies, improving customer experience and reducing attrition rates.
- Mitigate churn, improve customer satisfaction, and foster long-lasting customer relationships.

In this project aims, I will initially perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to provide valuable insights to the bank and visualise the factors contributing to customer churn.
